        <h1>Lesson 2: Practicing Songwriting</h1>
        <p><i>This lesson offers a plan for growing your songwriting/composing skills (no actual "music theory" in this one).</i></p>
        <p>Songwriters seem to use two basic approaches to growing their skills:</p>
        <li>Intuitive Approach</li>
        <li>Analytical Approach</li>

        <h3>Intuitive Approach</h3>
        <p>In an intuitive approach, you just write what "comes naturally". You don't analyze music or do "exercises". Most composers (myself included) probably started this way, and plenty of composers use only this approach.</p>

        <p>If you're happy with an intuitive approach, that's great. But if:</p>
        <li>You're in a rut (you feel like you only have a few different musical ideas);</li>
        <li>You hear music and think "how can I write something like that?";</li>
        <p>... then an analytical approach can help.</p>
        <h3>Analytical Approach</h3>
        <p>In an analytical approach, you study why good music sounds good (which is just what "music theory" is). And you can combine theory with a structured practice plan which helps you actually use the theory when you write.</p>

        <h3>A Structured Practice Plan</h3>
        <p>Your own personal practice plan can take many forms. Heres an example you can use as-is or for inspiration:</p>

        <h4>Major activities:</h4>
        <p>Divide your practice time among these 3 major activities:</p>
        <li>Writing</li>
        <li>Analyzing</li>
        <li>Exercises</li>

        <h4>Writing:</h4>
        <p>To grow your writing skills, you have to write (of course).</p>

        <h4>Analyzing:</h4>
        <p>This means, study good music and figure out why it sounds good, how it's using music theory concepts, "how it works". This is what these Pop Music Theory lessons are all about. </p>

        <h4>Exercises:</h4>
        <p>Finally, to connect analyzing and writing, do "writing exercises" to practice actually using the theory concepts you learn. These lessons suggest some exercises, but you can also invent your own.</p>

        <h4>Next:</h4>
        <p>The "real theory" starts with Lesson 3: Pitch Names.</p>
